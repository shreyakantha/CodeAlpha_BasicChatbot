# 🤖 Basic Chatbot (Rule-Based)
This project implements a simple rule-based chatbot using Python. The chatbot interacts with users through predefined text inputs such as greetings, common questions, and exit commands, and responds with fixed and appropriate replies.  
The chatbot runs in a continuous loop, processes user input from the console, and demonstrates basic conversational flow using conditional logic. It is designed as a beginner-friendly project to practice core Python programming concepts.

---
## 🎯 Goal
Build a basic rule-based chatbot that accepts user input such as greetings and simple questions, responds with predefined messages, and exits gracefully when the user types a termination command.

---
## ⭐ Features
- Accepts real-time user input from the console
- Responds to predefined inputs such as greetings and common questions
- Handles variations in user input by normalizing text and removing punctuation
- Maintains a simple conversational flow using follow-up responses
- Runs continuously until the user types `bye`
- Beginner-friendly and easy to extend

---
## 🧠 Key Concepts Used
- Functions
- `if-elif-else` conditions
- Loops
- Dictionaries
- String handling
- Console input and output

---
## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language :** Python 3.x
- **Library Used :** `string` for punctuation handling

---
## ⚙️ Requirements
- Python 3.x installed on the system

## 🗨️ Sample Interaction
Below is a sample interaction with the chatbot :
```bash
Bot: Hello! I'm a simple chatbot. Type 'bye' to exit.
You: hey
Bot: Hey there!
You: how are you?
Bot: I'm fine, thanks! How are you?
You: fine
Bot: Glad to hear that!
You: tell me something about yourself
Bot: I'm a simple rule-based chatbot, created using Python.
You: great
Bot: I don't understand that. Try 'hello', 'help', or 'bye'.
You: help
Bot: You can say hello, ask how I am, or type bye to exit.
You: bye
Bot: Goodbye!
```

## 🚀 Deployment
This is a console-based Python script and does not require deployment.
It can be executed on any system with Python installed.

---
## ⚡ Optimizations
- Uses input normalization (lowercasing and punctuation removal) for better matching
- Dictionary-based responses for cleaner and scalable logic
- Simple state tracking to support follow-up conversation

---
## 📚 Lessons Learned
- Designing rule-based conversational logic
- Handling user input variations
- Structuring interactive Python scripts
- Improving readability and maintainability using dictionaries

---
## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Add partial input matching for more natural conversation
- Expand response coverage for more questions
- Add basic conversation history
- Convert the chatbot into a GUI or web-based interface

---
## 📄 Documentation
The code is structured for clarity and readability. Each logical block is easy to understand, making the project suitable for beginners learning Python control flow and user interaction.
